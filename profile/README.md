# 🔎 Open Modelling for Africa (OM4A) – Training Platform

Welcome to the OM4A Training Platform, the educational section of the  [**Open Modelling Toolbox for Africa**](https://africaenergymodels.net/) developed under the Horizon Europe Energy project **101118123 – OpenMod4Africa**. Through the use of this Toolbox, this platform supports the development of local expertise and skills in energy system modelling, particularly across the African continent, contributing to robust, data-driven planning for sustainable, secure, and inclusive energy future.


## 🎯 About the Project

**OpenMod4Africa** is a three-year Horizon Europe project (2023–2026) dedicated to the development and dissemination of an **open-source energy modelling toolbox** to analyze future African energy and power systems. A central component of the project, to which this platform responds, is capacity building — equipping African experts and stakeholders with the tools and knowledge needed to conduct regional, national, and pan-African energy scenario analyses.

The project involves collaboration with stakeholders, engaged through a [African Energy Modelling Network](https://africanenergymodellingnetwork.net/en/home).


## 🧰 Models in the Toolbox

🛠 **GENeSYS-MOD**  
  A linear, open-source energy system model extending the OSeMOSYS framework. It enables integrated optimization of generation, dispatch, and sector coupling across electricity, buildings, transport, and industry.  

🛠 **OpenTEPES**  
 The openTEPES model is a decision support system for defining the integrated generation, storage, and transmission expansion plan of a power system, though it can also be used to compute the expansion of certain technologies within that system, typically the transmission grid.

🛠 **Plan4res**  
  A modular power system model supporting capacity expansion, seasonal storage management, and system operation simulations with interconnection representations.

🛠️ **InfraFair**  
  An open model for network cost allocation and tariff design. It estimates agent responsibility for infrastructure based on usage, with applicability to both electricity and other flow-based networks.

🛠 **OnSSET**  
  A spatial electrification planning tool using GIS data and demographic inputs to optimize least-cost pathways for universal electricity access in unserved areas.

🛠 **EV-PV**  
  A GIS-based planning model for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, developed within the Citiwatts platform. It supports geospatial planning for EV deployment aligned with solar PV integration.
  

## 🎓 Training Platform

The OM4A Training Platform provides a structured learning environment for:

- Understanding the integrated Toolbox models and database;
- Supporting the stakeholder in simulating scenario-based energy planning at national and regional levels by running the models;
- Visualizing and interpreting model assumptions and outputs;
- Building capacity in open-source modelling methodologies and practices.

Further training materials and tutorials will be progressively made available in this repository to support African scientists, planners, and institutions.


## 🧑‍💻 Who Is This For?


This platform is tailored for:

- African research institutes and universities;
- National energy planners and ministries;
- Regional energy communities (e.g., EAPP, WAPP);
- NGOs, civil society, and donor-funded technical assistance projects;
- Anyone interested in open, accessible energy modelling tools for Africa.
