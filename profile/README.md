# üîé Open Modelling for Africa (OM4A) ‚Äì Training Platform

Welcome to the OM4A Training Platform, the educational section of the  [**Open Modelling Toolbox for Africa**](https://africaenergymodels.net/) developed under the Horizon Europe Energy project **101118123 ‚Äì OpenMod4Africa**. Through the use of this Toolbox, this platform supports the development of local expertise and skills in energy system modelling, particularly across the African continent, contributing to robust, data-driven planning for sustainable, secure, and inclusive energy future.


## üéØ About the Project

**OpenMod4Africa** is a three-year Horizon Europe project (2023‚Äì2026) dedicated to the development and dissemination of an **open-source energy modelling toolbox** to analyze future African energy and power systems. A central component of the project, to which this platform responds, is capacity building ‚Äî equipping African experts and stakeholders with the tools and knowledge needed to conduct regional, national, and pan-African energy scenario analyses.

The project involves collaboration with stakeholders, engaged through a [African Energy Modelling Network](https://africanenergymodellingnetwork.net/en/home).


## üß∞ Models in the Toolbox
üõ† [**EV-PV**](https://github.com/OM4A-Training-Material/EV-PV-Training-Material)
  A GIS-based planning model for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, developed within the Citiwatts platform. It supports geospatial planning for EV deployment aligned with solar PV integration.

üõ† [**GENeSYS-MOD**](https://github.com/OM4A-Training-Material/GENeSYS-MOD-Training-Material)   
  A linear, open-source energy system model extending the OSeMOSYS framework. It enables integrated optimization of generation, dispatch, and sector coupling across electricity, buildings, transport, and industry.  

üõ†Ô∏è [**InfraFair**](https://github.com/OM4A-Training-Material/InfraFair-Training-Material) 
  An open model for network cost allocation and tariff design. It estimates agent responsibility for infrastructure based on usage, with applicability to both electricity and other flow-based networks.

üõ† [**OnSSET**](https://github.com/OM4A-Training-Material/OnSSET-Training-Material)
  A spatial electrification planning tool using GIS data and demographic inputs to optimize least-cost pathways for universal electricity access in unserved areas.
  
üõ† [**openTEPES**](https://github.com/OM4A-Training-Material/openTEPES-Training-Material)
 The openTEPES model is a decision support system for defining the integrated generation, storage, and transmission expansion plan of a power system, though it can also be used to compute the expansion of certain technologies within that system, typically the transmission grid.

üõ† [**Plan4res**](https://github.com/OM4A-Training-Material/plan4res-Training-Material)  
  A modular power system model supporting capacity expansion, seasonal storage management, and system operation simulations with interconnection representations.

## üéì Training Platform

The OM4A Training Platform provides a structured learning environment for:

- Understanding the integrated Toolbox models and database;
- Supporting the stakeholder in simulating scenario-based energy planning at national and regional levels by running the models;
- Visualizing and interpreting model assumptions and outputs;
- Building capacity in open-source modelling methodologies and practices.

Further training materials and tutorials will be progressively made available in this repository to support African scientists, planners, and institutions.


## üßë‚Äçüíª Who Is This For?


This platform is tailored for:

- African research institutes and universities;
- National energy planners and ministries;
- Regional energy communities (e.g., EAPP, WAPP);
- NGOs, civil society, and donor-funded technical assistance projects;
- Anyone interested in open, accessible energy modelling tools for Africa.
